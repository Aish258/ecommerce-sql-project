🚀 Project Showcase – E-commerce Data Analysis using SQL 🛍️

I'm excited to share my recent hands-on project where I analyzed E-commerce Sales Data using SQL to extract meaningful business insights.

📌 Key Insights and Tasks:

Filtered and extracted data from multiple tables like orders, payments, products, and customers.

Applied WHERE, LIKE, BETWEEN, IN, and logical operators for data filtering.

Used aggregation functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT, MAX, MIN) to calculate total sales, average payments, top-selling products, and customer distributions.

Explored data cleaning techniques, including replacing blank values with NULL and trimming strings.

Used JOINS to combine data across customers, orders, and payments.

Applied window functions like RANK() and DENSE_RANK() to rank top order dates based on sales.

Created views and CTEs to structure complex queries for better readability and analysis.

Analyzed sales trends, payment methods, city/state-level customer behavior, and top-selling products.

Segmented products based on total revenue into Low, Medium, and Max sales categories.

📊 This project helped me:

Deepen my SQL skills

Gain confidence in solving real-world business problems using data

Understand the structure and patterns of online retail datasets
